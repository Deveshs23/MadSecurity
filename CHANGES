 - Fixed XML Schema validation, which previously worked only if you enabled
   the super-insecure mode where XXEs are allowed.

 - Made phases 1 and 2 both run in the same Apache hook, just prior to the
   request being processed by Apache. This allows phase 1 rules to be placed
   in Location tags.
